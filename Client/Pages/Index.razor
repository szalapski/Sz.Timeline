30 Jesus Grace, forgiveness, love, altruism
40 PhiloJudaeus On the Special Laws; Hellenistic Judaism; transcendence of God
60 Paul Christian theology and ecclesiology
100 Epictetus Discourses, Encheiridion; The will

1619 Descartes  I am thinking, therefore I am; everything further is unsure (Cartesian doubt, rationalism); Trademark argument: I exist and have the idea of God, for he placed this idea in me as the mark of the craftsman stamped on his work.
1660 Spinoza  Hard determinism: the past (and nothing else) brings about the present and future
1690 Locke  The same man can be inhabited by different persons; I am not the man I was 30 years ago.
1776 Hume  Basic reliability of sense perception (natural foundationalism, empiricism); The self is a bundle of experiences and there is no “owner”; it cannot even be said that we are aware of our selves; No existence is necessary; we can conceive that God doesn’t exist.
1839 Shopenhauer  Compatibilism: “could have done otherwise” means “would have done otherwise if they had chosen differently and would have chosen differently under certain circumstances”
1781 Kant “Freedom” of clockwork; My experiences are mine (they require me to even exist)--they require self-consciousness; “I” is the point-of-view from which experience starts. Experiences are not things in their own right.
1785 Reid  The self/soul is simple, not composite.
1078 Anselm  Ontological argument: God can be conceived, therefore he must exist in reality. (Suppose he doesn’t; then a greater being can be conceived, that is, one who exists)
1250 ThomasAquinas  Cosmological argument: all things observable are caused, so there must be an uncaused necessary first cause that self-exists and was not caused.
1658 Pascal  Pascal’s Wager
1953 Wittgenstein  If God is incomprehensible, “A nothing will serve just as well as a something about which nothing could be said.” If mind and body are separate, we can’t assume anyone thinks like we do (beetle)
1825 Coleridge  “He who begins by loving Christianity better than truth will proceed by loving his own Church better than Christianity and end in loving himself better than all.”
